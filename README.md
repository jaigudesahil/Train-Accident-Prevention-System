# Train-Prevention-System
The Train Accident Prevention System is an innovative application of Arduino technology designed to enhance railway safety. This system employs an ultrasonic sensor, LEDs, and a buzzer to prevent potential accidents by detecting obstacles or objects on railway tracks. It operates by continuously monitoring the proximity of objects to the tracks and issuing warnings or alerts when objects are detected within a predefined safety range.
# Key Features:

An array of LEDs provides visual indicators, each representing a specific distance from the railway tracks. These LEDs light up to show the proximity of obstacles.

A buzzer generates audible alerts when objects are detected dangerously close to the railway tracks.

The heart of the system is the ultrasonic sensor, which accurately measures the distance between the system and objects on the tracks.

When the system detects an object within a specific range, it triggers the LEDs to flash and activates the buzzer, alerting railway personnel and potentially avoiding accidents.

Real-time distance measurements are also displayed on the Serial monitor, enabling monitoring and analysis of the system's performance.

# Use Case:

The Train Accident Prevention System is an essential tool for railway safety. It can be deployed in various railway segments to prevent collisions with obstacles or obstructions on the tracks.

This system helps railway operators and personnel to proactively respond to potential hazards and improve overall railway safety.
